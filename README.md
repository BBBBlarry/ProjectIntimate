# ProjectIntimate
This is just a prototype of the project :D

<h2>The goal is...</h2>
	The goal of the project is trying to make it easier for web developers to find user-intersted image contents. 

<h2>How do I take advantages of this... prototype?</h2>
	The main part of the project will be written in a web-developing language instead afterwards in order for real usages. For now, you can freely expolore a simple command user interface, where you can 
	...sign in as a user, (<i>sign in [username]</i>), sign up for a new user (<i>sign up [username]</i>), show sample pictures in the system (<i>show pictures</i>), open a sample picture, which are not REAL pictures :p (<i>open picture [title]</i>), close the picture that's open right now (<i>close picture</i>), and finally, open up admin mode (<i>admin</i>)...
